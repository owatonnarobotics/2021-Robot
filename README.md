# FRC Team 4624's 2021-Robot
All software for the Rebel Alliance's 2021 season and its game, Infinite
Recharge. This code is a continuation of the Rebel Alliance's 2020 robot
code, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Wizzrobes/2020-Robot-Code).

## 2021-Robot
The primary project for 2021: commanding Zion to play this year's game.
### Description
4624's 2021 robot resides on a swerve drivetrain based on Team 2910's
Swerve Drive Specialties MKII swerve modules. Controlling this is
the first objective of the project, with movement and rotation in
any direction and of any combination. Methods then exist for
operating an intake to store Power Cells, as well as a launcher
for throwing them. Finally, this is all wrapped in a system of
fully autonomous extension methods to complete tasks such as
positioning, alignment, launching, and climbing either
automatically or with autonomous driver assistance.
### Documentation
The code in this project is fully documented, and a thorough
description of each class and method exists at the beginning
of its respective header file.
### Compiling/Usage
This is a 2021 WPILib project which uses vendor libraries from
REV and Kaui for motor controller and sensor functionality.
With an up-to-date install of WPILib VSCode and these
vendor libraries installed, the project can be imported
and built automatically through GradleRIO. Otherwise, the
code can be browsed on GitHub or locally.
