class HAL

Allows low-level automatic control of the robot as a secondary driver. The
    whole class is really just a conglomarate wrapper for auto functionality.
    All that each function does at the end of the day is write values to the
    motors - just like a real driver, to preserve full compatibility with
    TeleOp. As such, cancellation is possible either by not calling the
    function any longer or by simply overwriting motor values before they
    are set at the end of the loop. Each function returns true when success
    is fulfilled, so an order of autonomous as follows:
    if (taskOne) {
        if (taskTwo) {
            if (taskThree) {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    will complete tasks one, two, and three in that order, waiting for success
    from each before continuing, assuming that each if also has a global
    control in it if being run in a loop. See zionShootingPositionToTrenchGrab
    for an example of this.

Constructors

    HAL(Intake&, Launcher&, Limelight&, NavX&, SwerveTrain&)
        Creates an autonomous driver with access to everything necessary
        for autonomous operation on the robot.

Public Methods

    bool zionAssumeDirection(const int&)
        Uses a supplied ZionDirections to set the swerves to the
        appropriate position to move in that direction. Sets no speed
        to the motors! Thus, the normal order is direction, distance, then
        back to original direction. This system allows precise movement in
        setting the swerves to one position and then moving back and forth
        between them without swerve wobble, such as when lining up laterally
        with the high goal.
    bool zionAssumeDistance(const double&)
        Uses the supplied distance to move that far in whatever direction
        the swerves are currently set for. As such, the usual order is a
        zionAssumeDirection followed by this. Zero speed is set once the
        distance is achieved; distance measured by the circumference of a
        wheel.
    bool zionAssumeRotationDegrees(const double&)
        Rotates the desired number of degrees using the NavX sensor. Does
        so at a constant global speed; could likely be regressed similarly
        to the swerve modules. Returns to zero position when done.
    void zionShootingPositionToTrenchGrab()
        Moves laterally and rotationally from the auto shooting position
        in front of the high goal through the trench to pick up more
        Power Cells. Actuates the intake appropriately in the process.
    void zionTrenchGrabToShootingPosition()
        Same as above, but minus the intake and the exact opposite
        movements, with more launching.

    enum ZionDirections
        Used by the assume functions to specify which directions to
        apply motion.

Private Methods

    void setZionMotorsToVector(const VectorDouble &)
        Sets the swerve positions on Zion to the angle of the passed vector
        inscribed in standard position. Used to assume directions by vector.
        This makes for easy, accurate, and actually sensible positioning, as
        the vectors to move in cardinal directions are just the signed
        cartesian axes.
